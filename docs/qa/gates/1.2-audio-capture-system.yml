# Final assessment
assessment: |
  The Audio Capture System implementation sets an exemplary standard for code quality,
  architecture design, and testing practices. The implementation not only meets all
  functional requirements but demonstrates engineering excellence that will serve as
  a foundation for the entire MeetingMind application.
  
  Key achievements:
  - 100% acceptance criteria coverage with comprehensive evidence
  - Zero critical or high-severity issues identified
  - Performance requirements exceeded (startup <1s, latency <100ms)
  - Security and privacy requirements fully satisfied
  - Extensive test coverage across all layers
  - Code architecture supports future extensibility
  
  This implementation is ready for production use and provides a solid foundation
  for the next phase of MeetingMind development.
