# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.4: AI-Powered Summarization
schema: 1
story: "1.4"
story_title: "AI-Powered Summarization"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent architectural implementation with comprehensive AI integration, but critical test coverage gaps prevent production readiness for cost-sensitive AI features."

    finding: "Zero test coverage for critical AI frontend components (CostTracker, SummaryView, SummaryGeneration)"
    suggested_action: "Add comprehensive React component tests with Vitest and Testing Library"
  - id: "TEST-002"  
    severity: high
    finding: "No integration tests for OpenAI/Claude client implementations or fallback logic"
    suggested_action: "Implement AI service integration tests with mock providers and failure scenarios"
  - id: "TEST-003"
    severity: high
    finding: "Cost tracking accuracy unvalidated - critical for user trust and billing transparency"
    suggested_action: "Create cost calculation validation tests with various token usage scenarios"
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "30-second performance requirement unvalidated through testing"
    suggested_action: "Add performance validation tests for summary generation latency"
