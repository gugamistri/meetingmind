- [ ] Consistent output quality across platforms (>95% similarity)
- [ ] No platform-specific crashes or errors
- [ ] Memory usage within 10% variance across platforms

**GO/NO-GO Decision Point 1**: If any platform fails basic compatibility, implement platform-specific solutions before proceeding.

#### Day 4-7: Performance Baseline Validation  
**Objective**: Validate <3 second latency requirement is achievable

**Tasks**:
1. Test inference latency with 30-second audio samples
2. Profile performance on minimum hardware (4GB RAM, dual-core CPU)

**GO/NO-GO Decision Point 2**: If performance requirements cannot be met, adjust model size or processing strategy.

#### Week 2: Integration Readiness Assessment
**Objective**: Validate integration points with existing systems

**Tasks**:
1. Test audio pipeline integration with Story 1.2 components
2. Validate real-time processing proof-of-concept
3. Test database integration with basic transcription storage
