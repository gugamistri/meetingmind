## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-002: Transcription Data Privacy
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Will definitely send data to external AI services
**Impact**: High (3) - Legal liability and privacy violations

Meeting transcriptions contain sensitive business data that will be transmitted to external AI services (OpenAI, Claude). This creates significant privacy and compliance risks.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement explicit user consent for external AI processing
- Add privacy controls to keep processing local-only by default
- Implement data anonymization/redaction before external processing
- Clear privacy notices about data transmission to AI services
- GDPR/CCPA compliance review required

**Testing Focus**: Privacy controls testing, consent flow validation, data anonymization accuracy

### 2. BUS-001: Unexpected Cost Overruns
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - AI services are expensive and usage unpredictable
**Impact**: High (3) - Financial liability and user dissatisfaction

AI API costs can escalate rapidly with heavy usage. Users may not understand cost implications, leading to budget overruns.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement hard budget limits with automatic cutoffs
- Real-time cost estimation before processing
- Monthly/daily usage caps with user notifications
- Transparent cost display in UI
- Cost alerts at 50%, 75%, 90% of budget

**Testing Focus**: Cost calculation accuracy, budget enforcement, alert mechanisms

### 3. TECH-001: AI Service Integration Complexity
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex integrations always have issues
**Impact**: High (3) - System failure if AI services don't work properly

Multiple AI providers with different APIs, fallback logic, rate limiting, and retry mechanisms create significant technical complexity.

**Mitigation**:
- Simplify architecture with unified AI service interface
- Comprehensive integration testing with mock services
- Circuit breaker pattern for service failures
- Detailed error handling and logging
- Gradual rollout with feature flags

**Testing Focus**: Fallback logic testing, error scenario coverage, integration test suite
