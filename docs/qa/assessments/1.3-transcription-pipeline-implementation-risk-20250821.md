- **Medium Risks**: 4
- **Low Risks**: 2
- **Risk Score**: 0/100 (Extremely High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: ONNX Runtime Cross-Platform Compatibility Issues

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - Different OS audio systems, library versions, CPU architectures create significant compatibility challenges  
**Impact**: High (3) - Core transcription feature complete failure on some platforms  

**Description**: ONNX Runtime behavior differs significantly across Windows/macOS/Linux, potentially causing transcription failures or severe performance degradation. Platform-specific audio system differences, varying library versions, and CPU architecture differences (Intel vs Apple Silicon) create complex compatibility matrices.

**Mitigation**:
- Establish comprehensive cross-platform testing infrastructure before development
- Create platform-specific ONNX build configurations and testing
- Implement runtime platform detection with appropriate model loading strategies
- Build fallback mechanisms for platform-specific failures
- Early prototype validation on all target platforms

**Testing Focus**: 
- Cross-platform integration testing on Windows 10/11, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon, Ubuntu Linux
- Hardware compatibility testing across different CPU architectures
- ONNX Runtime version compatibility validation

### 2. PERF-001: Sub-3 Second Latency Requirement Failure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - ML inference is computationally expensive, especially on lower-end devices  
**Impact**: High (3) - Breaks core product promise of real-time transcription, poor user experience  

**Description**: Local Whisper processing may exceed the 3-second latency requirement due to model complexity, insufficient hardware resources, or inefficient processing pipeline. This risk is especially high on lower-end devices or systems with limited CPU/memory resources.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive performance benchmarking with minimum hardware specifications
- Create model size vs performance trade-off analysis (tiny vs base models)
- Build adaptive processing that scales with hardware capabilities
- Implement efficient memory management and CPU optimization
- Consider hardware detection with appropriate model selection

**Testing Focus**: 
- Performance testing under minimum hardware specifications
- Latency stress testing with various audio qualities and durations
- Memory usage profiling during extended transcription sessions

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing**:
- ONNX Runtime compatibility across Windows 10/11, macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), Ubuntu Linux
- Hardware-specific testing on minimum spec devices (4GB RAM, dual-core CPU)

## Risk Review Triggers

**Review and update risk profile when:**

- New target platform or hardware configuration requirements
- Significant changes to audio processing pipeline from Story 1.2
- User reports of transcription quality or performance issues
- Privacy regulations or security requirements change
- Cloud API provider terms or pricing changes

## Recommendations for Development Phase

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Prototype Validation Phase**: Create minimal ONNX integration prototype to validate cross-platform compatibility and performance assumptions before full implementation
2. **Hardware Baseline Testing**: Establish minimum hardware requirements through extensive performance testing
3. **Privacy Framework**: Implement robust privacy controls and audit framework for cloud integration
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Set up cross-platform testing environment with automated performance benchmarking

### Development Approach Modifications

1. **Phased Implementation**: Consider implementing local-only transcription first, adding cloud fallback in subsequent iteration
2. **Performance-First Design**: Make performance optimization a primary concern throughout implementation
3. **Extensive Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities from the start
4. **User Expectation Management**: Clearly communicate performance limitations and privacy controls

### Quality Gate Impact

**Gate Decision: FAIL** - Critical risks in core functionality require resolution before development begins.

This story should not proceed to development until:
1. Cross-platform ONNX compatibility is validated through prototyping
2. Performance requirements are validated on target hardware
3. Privacy controls framework is designed and approved
4. Testing infrastructure for critical risks is established
