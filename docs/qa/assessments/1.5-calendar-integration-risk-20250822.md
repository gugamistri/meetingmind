## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: OAuth2 Token Security Implementation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex security implementation with encryption requirements
**Impact**: High - Data breach, account compromise, reputation damage if implemented incorrectly
**Mitigation**:

- Implement ChaCha20Poly1305 encryption for all token storage in SQLite
- Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for OAuth2 flow security
- Add state validation for OAuth2 flow to prevent CSRF attacks
- Implement secure token rotation and automatic renewal logic
- Create comprehensive OAuth2 callback handler with proper validation
- Add secure token revocation and logout functionality

**Testing Focus**: Security penetration testing, token encryption validation, OAuth2 flow security testing

## High Priority Risks

### 2. SEC-002: Calendar Data Privacy Violation
**Score: 6 (High)** | **Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
- Calendar data contains sensitive PII that could violate privacy regulations
- **Mitigation**: Implement data classification, user controls for sensitive events, local-only processing

### 3. TECH-001: Google Calendar API Integration Failure
**Score: 6 (High)** | **Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
- External API dependency with rate limiting and availability concerns
- **Mitigation**: Exponential backoff, comprehensive error handling, fallback to cached data

### 4. PERF-001: Meeting Detection Timing Accuracy
**Score: 6 (High)** | **Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
- 5-minute detection window requires precise timing and may miss meetings
- **Mitigation**: Smart detection with confidence scoring, audio analysis backup, user notifications

### 5. DATA-001: Calendar Cache Consistency Issues
**Score: 6 (High)** | **Probability**: High | **Impact**: Medium
- Complex sync logic with external data source prone to consistency issues
- **Mitigation**: Incremental sync with change detection, cache validation mechanisms

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **OAuth2 Security Testing**
  - Penetration testing of OAuth2 flow
  - Token encryption/decryption validation
  - PKCE implementation security review
  - CSRF protection verification
  - Token storage encryption at rest validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Calendar API Integration Testing**
  - API failure simulation and recovery
  - Rate limiting behavior validation
  - Network partition testing
  - Error handling comprehensive testing

- **Meeting Detection Accuracy Testing**
  - Timing precision validation (5-minute window)
  - Edge case scenarios (meetings starting early/late)
  - Audio analysis backup testing
  - User notification system testing

- **Privacy Compliance Testing**
  - Calendar data handling validation
  - PII detection and protection
  - Data retention policy enforcement
  - User control functionality verification

- **Cache Consistency Testing**
  - Incremental sync validation
  - Conflict resolution testing
  - Cache invalidation scenarios
  - Sync failure recovery testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Browser Compatibility Testing**
  - Cross-platform OAuth2 flow testing
  - Browser-specific behavior validation

- **Database Migration Testing**
  - Schema migration validation
  - Data integrity verification
  - Rollback procedure testing

- **Resource Usage Testing**
  - Background sync performance monitoring
  - Battery usage validation
  - Memory consumption testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: OAuth2 Token Security Implementation (Critical)
- All high-risk security and data privacy issues
- Meeting detection timing accuracy requirements

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls in place
- Browser compatibility issues with documented workarounds
- Performance issues with monitoring and alerting

### Accepted Risks

- Background sync resource usage (low impact, well-tested patterns available)
- Rate limiting scenarios (generous limits, proper error handling implemented)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Security Metrics**: OAuth2 authentication success/failure rates, token refresh failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Meeting detection accuracy, calendar sync latency, API response times
- **Operational Metrics**: Calendar API rate limit utilization, sync failure rates, user error reports
- **Business KPIs**: Calendar integration adoption rate, meeting capture success rate

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- OAuth2 security vulnerabilities are discovered in dependencies
- Google Calendar API changes are announced
- Meeting detection accuracy falls below 95%
- User privacy concerns are reported
- New calendar providers are added
- Database performance issues are identified

## Overall Assessment

**Risk Score: 21/100 (High Risk)**

Story 1.5 presents significant security and integration challenges that require careful implementation and thorough testing. The critical OAuth2 security risk must be addressed with industry best practices and comprehensive security testing. High-priority risks around calendar API integration and meeting detection accuracy need robust mitigation strategies and fallback mechanisms.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with development but implement all critical and high-risk mitigations before production deployment. Consider phased rollout with beta testing for OAuth2 flow validation.
