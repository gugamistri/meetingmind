# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.3 - Transcription Pipeline Implementation

### Coverage Summary

- **Total Requirements**: 8
- **Fully Covered**: 2 (25%)
- **Partially Covered**: 5 (62.5%)
- **Not Covered**: 1 (12.5%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Local Whisper ONNX models process captured audio with <3 seconds latency

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `tests.rs::test_model_manager`
  - Given: ModelManager is initialized with ONNX Runtime
  - When: Model availability and memory stats are checked
  - Then: Model status is correctly reported and memory tracking works
  - **Gap**: No actual ONNX model loading due to mock implementation

- **Performance Test**: `tests.rs::test_performance_benchmark`
  - Given: 10 seconds of test audio data
  - When: Audio preprocessing is performed
  - Then: Operation completes under 1000ms threshold
  - **Gap**: Only tests preprocessing, not full ONNX inference latency

**Critical Gap**: ONNX Runtime is currently mocked due to macOS ARM64 compatibility issues. No actual inference latency validation.

#### AC2: Real-time transcription display appears in UI with <5 second delay

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Component Test**: `RealTimeTranscription.test.tsx::handles chunk received callback`
  - Given: Real-time transcription component with session ID
  - When: Transcription chunks are received via Tauri events
  - Then: UI updates display transcription chunks with proper formatting
  - **Gap**: No timing validation for 5-second delay requirement

- **Component Test**: `RealTimeTranscription.test.tsx::displays live indicator when transcribing`
  - Given: Transcription service is active
  - When: Component renders in transcribing state
  - Then: Live indicator and transcription display are shown
  - **Gap**: No performance testing of UI update speed

**Critical Gap**: No performance testing validates the <5 second UI delay requirement.

#### AC3: Transcription confidence scoring validates quality with >80% accuracy threshold

**Coverage: PARTIAL** (Configuration Mismatch)

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `tests.rs::test_transcription_chunk`
  - Given: TranscriptionChunk with confidence scores (0.95, 0.8, etc.)
  - When: Confidence validation methods are called
  - Then: Correct confidence assessment and high/low confidence determination
  - **Coverage**: Complete confidence logic testing

- **Unit Test**: `tests.rs::test_transcription_config`
  - Given: Default transcription configuration
  - When: Configuration is initialized
  - Then: Confidence threshold is set to 0.7
  - **Issue**: Configuration shows 0.7 threshold, not 0.8 as required by AC3

- **Component Test**: `RealTimeTranscription.test.tsx::filters chunks by confidence threshold`
  - Given: Chunks with varying confidence levels
  - When: Confidence threshold filtering is applied (0.7)
  - Then: Only high-confidence chunks are displayed
  - **Issue**: Tests 0.7 threshold, not 0.8 requirement

**Critical Gap**: Configuration mismatch - system uses 0.7 threshold instead of required >0.8.

#### AC4: Automatic language detection supports English and Portuguese languages

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `tests.rs::test_language_detection`
  - Given: LanguageCode enum instances (En, Pt, Auto)
  - When: Language codes are converted to string representation
  - Then: Correct string values ("en", "pt", "auto") are returned
  - **Gap**: Only tests enum structure, not actual Whisper language detection

**Critical Gap**: No testing of actual language detection functionality with audio samples.

#### AC5: Hybrid processing provides cloud API fallback for low-confidence segments

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `tests.rs::test_cloud_processor`
  - Given: CloudProcessor with OpenAI configuration
  - When: Cloud processor is initialized
  - Then: Processor is created and usage stats are available
  - **Gap**: No actual API integration or fallback logic testing

- **Component Test**: `RealTimeTranscription.test.tsx::filters chunks by confidence threshold`
  - Given: Chunks with different confidence levels
  - When: Confidence filtering is applied
  - Then: Low-confidence chunks are filtered out
  - **Gap**: Tests filtering but not actual cloud fallback behavior

**Critical Gap**: No integration testing of local-to-cloud fallback mechanism.

#### AC6: Transcriptions are stored in SQLite database with full-text search capabilities

**Coverage: NONE**

**Critical Gap**: No database integration tests found. Implementation exists (schema documented in story) but no test validation of:
- Transcription storage operations
- FTS5 full-text search functionality  
- Database migration execution
- Search performance and relevance

#### AC7: Audio preprocessing optimizes input for Whisper model compatibility

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `tests.rs::test_audio_preprocessing`
  - Given: Audio data with values outside [-1.0, 1.0] range
  - When: normalize_audio method is called
  - Then: Audio is normalized to proper amplitude range
  - **Coverage**: Complete normalization testing

- **Unit Test**: `tests.rs::test_audio_preprocessing`
  - Given: 44.1kHz audio data
  - When: resample_audio method is called with 16kHz target
  - Then: Audio is resampled to 16kHz with correct sample count
  - **Coverage**: Complete resampling testing

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `tests.rs::test_integration_pipeline`
  - Given: Complete transcription pipeline with model manager
  - When: Audio chunks are processed through the pipeline
  - Then: Pipeline handles session management and audio processing
  - **Gap**: Uses mock implementation and expects failures in test environment

- **Unit Test**: `tests.rs::test_pipeline_session_management`
  - Given: Transcription pipeline instance
  - When: Session start/stop operations are performed
  - Then: Session lifecycle is managed correctly
  - **Gap**: No actual integration with Story 1.2 audio capture system

**Critical Gap**: No end-to-end integration testing with actual audio capture from Story 1.2.

### Test Design Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (Before Final Review)

1. **Database Integration Test Suite**
   ```rust
   #[tokio::test]
   async fn test_transcription_database_operations() {
       // Test: Insert transcription → Verify storage → Test FTS5 search
   }
   ```

2. **Performance Validation Tests**
   ```rust
   #[tokio::test]
   async fn test_transcription_latency_requirements() {
       // Test: Audio input → ONNX processing → <3 second validation
   }
   ```

3. **Configuration Fix**
   ```rust
   // Update TranscriptionConfig::default() confidence_threshold to 0.8
   ```

#### Integration Testing Strategy

1. **Audio Pipeline Integration**
   - Create end-to-end test: Audio capture (Story 1.2) → Transcription → Database storage
   - Validate real-time event flow from audio to UI

2. **Cloud Fallback Testing**
   - Test low-confidence local result → Cloud API call → Result integration
   - Validate cost tracking and transparent mode indicators

3. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Continuous audio stream processing
   - Memory usage under sustained operation
   - UI responsiveness during heavy processing

### Risk Assessment Summary
