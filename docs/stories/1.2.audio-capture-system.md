## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 1.1 completion:
- CPAL audio processing dependency is installed and configured
- Audio module structure established at `src-tauri/src/audio/mod.rs`
- Tauri 2.0 foundation operational with command/event system ready
- Testing framework configured for both unit and integration testing

### Core Technology Stack
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#audio-processing]

**CPAL (Cross-Platform Audio Library)**:
- Cross-platform audio I/O supporting Windows WASAPI, macOS Core Audio, Linux ALSA
- Low-latency audio processing with callback-based and blocking APIs  
- Support for both input and output devices with device enumeration
- Direct system API access for optimal performance
- Callback-based stream processing: `device.build_input_stream()` with real-time data processing

**Audio Processing Architecture**:
- Use f32 sample format for internal processing (CPAL standard)
- Target 16kHz mono output for transcription pipeline optimization
- Implement ring buffer for efficient audio data management
- Real-time audio level monitoring using RMS calculation

Create custom AudioError enum using thiserror:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum AudioError {
    #[error("Audio device not found: {device}")]
    DeviceNotFound { device: String },
    #[error("Permission denied for audio access")]
    PermissionDenied,
    #[error("Buffer overflow: {size} bytes")]
    BufferOverflow { size: usize },
    #[error("CPAL error: {0}")]
    Cpal(#[from] cpal::BuildStreamError),
    #[error("Device configuration error: {0}")]
    Config(#[from] cpal::DefaultStreamConfigError),
}
```
