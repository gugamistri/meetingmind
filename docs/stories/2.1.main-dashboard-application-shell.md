## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1-1.5, all backend functionality is complete and ready for UI integration:
- **Audio System (Story 1.2)**: AudioControls component exists and is fully functional
- **Transcription (Story 1.3)**: Backend transcription pipeline is operational
- **AI Summarization (Story 1.4)**: Summary generation system ready for UI integration
- **Calendar Integration (Story 1.5)**: Calendar services available for meeting detection
- **Database Layer**: SQLite with meeting storage, search, and metadata support

### Current UI Component Analysis
Based on existing codebase review:
- **AppShell component**: Basic layout exists but needs navigation enhancement
- **AudioControls component**: Fully featured recording controls ready for dashboard integration
- **Button/Card components**: Basic UI primitives available for dashboard construction
- **App.tsx**: Currently shows system status only - needs complete replacement with dashboard

### Data Models and Database Integration
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-structure], [Source: Stories 1.1-1.5 implementation records]

The dashboard will integrate with existing database models:
- **meetings table**: Contains all meeting records with metadata
- **calendar_events table**: Calendar integration data from Story 1.5
- **ai_summaries table**: Generated summaries from Story 1.4

Required dashboard data queries:
```typescript
interface DashboardData {
  recentMeetings: Meeting[];
  meetingStats: {
    totalMeetings: number;
    totalDuration: number;
    todaysMeetings: number;
    weeklyActivity: number;
  };
  upcomingEvents?: CalendarEvent[];
}
```

### Frontend Architecture and Component Structure
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-structure], [Source: architecture/6-user-interface-architecture.md]

**Component Hierarchy for Dashboard**:
```
Dashboard/
├── DashboardHeader (greeting + stats)
├── RecordingSection (AudioControls integration)
├── RecentMeetings/
│   ├── MeetingList
│   └── MeetingCard (clickable, shows title/date/duration)
├── QuickStats (total meetings, time, activity)
└── UpcomingMeetings (calendar integration)
```

**New Components to Create** (`src/components/dashboard/`):
- `Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard component
- `DashboardHeader.tsx` - Welcome section with time-based greeting
- `RecentMeetings.tsx` - Recent meetings list container
- `MeetingCard.tsx` - Individual meeting display card
- `QuickStats.tsx` - Meeting statistics widget
- `RecordingSection.tsx` - Prominent recording controls area

### Navigation and Routing Architecture
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-framework], [Source: prd/improvements.md#navigation]

**Required Navigation Structure**:
- **Home** (Dashboard) - Default route
- **Meetings** - Full meeting history with search/filter
- **Settings** - Audio, AI, Privacy preferences
- **Calendar** - Calendar integration management
- **Help** - User documentation and support

**Routing Implementation**:
```typescript
// src/router/AppRouter.tsx
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Dashboard },
  { path: '/meetings', component: MeetingHistory },
  { path: '/meetings/:id', component: MeetingDetails },
  { path: '/settings', component: Settings },
  { path: '/calendar', component: CalendarManagement },
];
```

### Integration Points with Existing Services
**Source References**: [Source: Stories 1.2-1.5 implementation records]
