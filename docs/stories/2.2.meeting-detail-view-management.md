## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.1 completed the main dashboard with meeting cards and navigation structure
- MeetingCard component includes quick action buttons that should navigate to this detail view
- AudioControls integration is established and working for recording functionality
- Backend services for meetings, transcription, and AI processing are implemented and ready

#[tauri::command]
async fn update_transcription_segment(
    segment_id: i64,
    text: String,
    speaker_id: Option<i64>
) -> Result<(), TranscriptionError>;

#[tauri::command]
async fn update_speaker_assignment(
    segment_id: i64,
    speaker_id: i64

#[tauri::command]
async fn generate_summary(
    meeting_id: i64,
    template_name: String,
    api_provider: String

#[tauri::command]
async fn export_meeting(
    meeting_id: i64,
    format: ExportFormat,
    options: ExportOptions

#[tauri::command]
async fn delete_meeting(meeting_id: i64) -> Result<(), MeetingError>;
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/9-development-guidelines.md#performance-guidelines]
- Export operations should be asynchronous with progress indicators for large files
- Transcription editing should auto-save with debouncing (500ms) to avoid excessive database writes
- Speaker assignments should be cached locally for quick access
- Summary generation should show cost estimates before API calls
- Export files should be cleaned up after 24 hours for privacy
- Database queries should use prepared statements for performance
- Search within transcription should use browser native search for responsiveness

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/9-development-guidelines.md#testing-strategy]
- Unit tests for all React components using Vitest and React Testing Library
- Test file locations: `src/components/meeting/*/[ComponentName].test.tsx`
- Mock Tauri commands using `vi.mock('@tauri-apps/api/tauri')`
- Integration tests for complete workflows in `tests/integration/meeting-detail.test.ts`
- Test error handling for network failures and invalid data states
- Accessibility tests using jest-axe for screen reader compatibility
- Performance tests for large transcription files (>1000 segments)

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/4-security-architecture.md#privacy-first-design]
- All transcription editing happens locally by default
- AI summary generation requires explicit user consent with cost display
- Export functionality should sanitize sensitive data based on user preferences
- Delete operations should be secure and irreversible with proper confirmation
- Temporary export links should expire and be cryptographically secure

## Testing

### Unit Testing Requirements
- Test all components in isolation with proper mocking
- Test custom hooks with renderHook from React Testing Library
- Mock all Tauri commands to avoid backend dependencies
- Test error boundaries and loading states
- Verify accessibility with jest-axe

### Integration Testing Requirements
- Test complete meeting detail workflow from navigation to export
- Test transcription editing with real-time save functionality
- Test speaker assignment and management flows
- Test summary generation with different templates
- Test export functionality for all supported formats

### Test File Locations
- Component tests: `src/components/meeting/*/[ComponentName].test.tsx`
- Hook tests: `src/hooks/[hookName].test.ts`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/meeting-detail-workflow.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/meeting-detail.spec.ts`
