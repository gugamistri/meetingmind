## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 (AI-Powered Summarization), the following integration points are established:
- `src-tauri/src/commands/` pattern for Tauri command handlers
- `src-tauri/src/events/` pattern for real-time event communication
- `src/stores/` pattern for Zustand state management
- Database integration pattern with repositories and migrations
- Secure configuration management using secrecy crate

### Data Models and Database Schema
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#database-layer], [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-structure]

Calendar integration requires extending the existing database schema with new tables:

```sql
-- Calendar accounts for OAuth2 token management
CREATE TABLE calendar_accounts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    provider TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'google', 'outlook'
    account_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    encrypted_access_token BLOB NOT NULL,
    encrypted_refresh_token BLOB NOT NULL,
    token_expires_at DATETIME,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    auto_start_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(provider, account_email)
);

-- Cached calendar events for offline operation
CREATE TABLE calendar_events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    calendar_account_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    external_event_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    start_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
    end_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
    participants TEXT, -- JSON array of participant emails
    location TEXT,
    meeting_url TEXT,
    is_accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    last_modified DATETIME,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (calendar_account_id) REFERENCES calendar_accounts (id),
    UNIQUE(calendar_account_id, external_event_id)
);

-- Extend meetings table for calendar integration
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN calendar_event_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN calendar_account_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN participants TEXT; -- JSON array
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN meeting_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN calendar_description TEXT;
```

### API Specifications and Integration Points
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/7-integration-architecture.md#calendar-integration]

**Google Calendar API Integration**:
- OAuth2 scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
- API endpoint: `https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events`
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests per 100 seconds per user
- Authentication: OAuth2 with PKCE for security

**Key Integration Patterns**:
```rust
// Google Calendar service trait
trait CalendarService: Send + Sync {
    async fn authenticate(&self) -> Result<AuthToken, CalendarError>;
    async fn fetch_events(&self, time_range: TimeRange) -> Result<Vec<CalendarEvent>, CalendarError>;
    async fn subscribe_to_changes(&self) -> Result<ChangeStream, CalendarError>;
}

// Meeting detection service
struct MeetingDetector {
    calendar_service: Box<dyn CalendarService>,
    audio_analyzer: AudioAnalyzer,
    notification_service: NotificationService,
}
```

### Security and Privacy Implementation
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/4-security-architecture.md], [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-practices]

**OAuth2 Security Requirements**:
- Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security
- Store tokens encrypted using ChaCha20Poly1305
- Implement token rotation and revocation
- Use secure random state generation for OAuth2 flow

**Privacy Protection**:
- Calendar data cached locally only
- No calendar data transmitted to external AI services
- User control over calendar data retention
- Option to exclude sensitive calendar events from detection

### Technical Implementation Details
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#http-client], [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#async-runtime]

**Required Dependencies** (add to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`):
```toml
oauth2 = "4.4"
url = "2.4"
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
google-calendar3 = "5.0"
secrecy = "0.8"
tokio-cron-scheduler = "0.9"
```

**HTTP Client Configuration**:
- Use reqwest with TLS 1.3 for API calls
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Add request/response logging for debugging
- Configure timeouts: 30s for OAuth2, 10s for API calls

### Error Handling and Fallback Strategies
**Source References**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum CalendarError {
    #[error("OAuth2 authentication failed: {reason}")]
    AuthenticationFailed { reason: String },
    #[error("Calendar service unavailable")]
    ServiceUnavailable,
    #[error("Rate limit exceeded, retry after {seconds}s")]
    RateLimitExceeded { seconds: u64 },
    #[error("Network error: {0}")]
    Network(#[from] reqwest::Error),
    #[error("Database error: {0}")]
    Database(#[from] sqlx::Error),
}
```

**Fallback Strategies**:
- Use cached calendar data when API is unavailable
- Graceful degradation to manual meeting creation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- User notification for authentication token expiration
