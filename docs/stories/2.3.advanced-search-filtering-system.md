- Story 2.2 completed meeting detail views with full transcription and management capabilities
- ExportManager system from 2.2 can be leveraged for search result export functionality
- MeetingCard components from dashboard provide good foundation for search result display

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/9-development-guidelines.md#performance-guidelines]
- Search queries must complete within 100ms for typical datasets (<1000 meetings)
- Search indexing should happen asynchronously to avoid blocking UI operations
- FTS5 indexes must be maintained automatically when meetings are added/updated
- Search suggestions should be debounced (300ms) to avoid excessive database queries
- Search results should be paginated (default: 50 results per page) for performance
- Search history should be limited to last 100 searches to prevent storage bloat
- All search operations must work offline and locally for privacy

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/9-development-guidelines.md#testing-strategy]
- Unit tests for all search components using Vitest and React Testing Library
- Test file locations: `src/components/search/*/[ComponentName].test.tsx`
- Mock Tauri search commands using `vi.mock('@tauri-apps/api/tauri')`
- Integration tests for complete search workflows in `tests/integration/search-workflow.test.ts`
- Performance tests for search operations with large datasets (1000+ meetings)
- Test search accuracy and relevance scoring with known datasets
- Accessibility tests using jest-axe for search interface components
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/4-security-architecture.md#privacy-first-design]
- All search operations execute locally using SQLite FTS5 - no external search services
- Search history and saved searches stored locally with same encryption as meeting data
- Search queries should not log sensitive content in debug logs
- Search export functionality should respect same privacy controls as meeting export
- Search indexing should respect user preferences for data processing
- No telemetry or analytics data should be sent about search behavior

## Testing

### Unit Testing Requirements
- Test all search components in isolation with proper mocking
- Test search service with various query types and edge cases
- Mock all search-related Tauri commands to avoid backend dependencies
- Test error handling for search failures and empty results
- Verify search result ranking and relevance scoring algorithms
- Test search filter combinations and edge cases

### Integration Testing Requirements
- Test complete search workflow from query input to result display
- Test search with real SQLite FTS5 integration (separate test database)
- Test search performance with varying dataset sizes
- Test search suggestions and autocomplete functionality
- Test saved searches persistence and retrieval
- Test search export functionality

### Performance Testing Requirements
- Benchmark search speed with datasets of 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 meetings
- Test search indexing performance during meeting creation
- Measure memory usage during search operations
- Test concurrent search operations performance
- Validate 100ms search response time requirement

### Test File Locations
- Component tests: `src/components/search/*/[ComponentName].test.tsx`
- Hook tests: `src/hooks/search/[hookName].test.ts`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/search-workflow.test.ts`
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/search-performance.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/search-functionality.spec.ts`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-08-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid technical architecture with comprehensive backend infrastructure. The SQLite FTS5 integration is well-designed with proper relevance scoring, timeout handling, and structured error management. The SearchService provides a robust foundation with good separation of concerns and async/await patterns. Frontend components show good React patterns with proper TypeScript integration.

However, the implementation has significant gaps between claimed completion and actual feature coverage. While the core search functionality is working, several key acceptance criteria remain unimplemented.

### Refactoring Performed

None - Code quality is architecturally sound. Issues are feature completeness rather than code quality problems.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Rust and TypeScript conventions properly
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper file organization and module structure
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Insufficient test coverage (only placeholder tests)
- All ACs Met: ✗ 6/10 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Missing Features (Must Complete):**
- [ ] Implement advanced filtering system (date ranges, participants, meeting duration)
- [ ] Add tagging system with database schema and UI components
- [ ] Optimize search performance to meet 100ms requirement (currently 5000ms timeout)
- [ ] Complete search result metadata (participant count, proper match type detection)
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for backend and frontend

**Code Completion Items:**
- [ ] Implement SearchFilters application in search queries (currently ignored)
- [ ] Add surrounding context for in-meeting search results
- [ ] Complete suggestion types beyond RecentQuery and PopularTerm
- [ ] Add proper participant counting in search results
- [ ] Implement match type detection (Title vs Content vs Participant)

**Performance & Polish:**
- [ ] Add search result caching for improved response times
- [ ] Implement search query optimization and indexing strategies
- [ ] Add search analytics and usage tracking
- [ ] Complete accessibility testing for search components

### Security Review

✓ **Privacy Compliance Excellent**: All search operations are local-only using SQLite FTS5. No external APIs, proper data isolation, and search history encryption follows existing patterns.

✓ **Input Validation**: Proper query validation and FTS query escaping implemented.

✓ **Error Handling**: No sensitive data exposure in error messages.

### Performance Considerations

❌ **Critical Performance Gap**: Story requires 100ms response time but implementation uses 5000ms timeout. This is a major discrepancy that needs immediate attention.

⚠️ **Optimization Opportunities**: 
- Search query optimization needed for large datasets
- FTS5 index maintenance strategy requires implementation
- Result pagination is basic (needs cursor-based pagination for better performance)

### Files Modified During Review

None - No code modifications performed during review.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.3-advanced-search-filtering-system.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/2.3-risk-20240822.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.3-nfr-20240822.md

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Core functionality is solid but 4 major acceptance criteria are incomplete or missing. With proper completion of advanced filters, tagging system, performance optimization, and testing, this could achieve 85+ score typical of previous stories.

### Review Date: 2025-08-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Exceptional improvement from previous CONCERNS assessment. James has successfully addressed all 4 critical issues identified in the previous review, transforming this from a 50/100 CONCERNS rating to production-ready quality. The advanced filtering system is now fully implemented with comprehensive UI components, the tagging system provides sophisticated autocomplete and management capabilities, performance has been optimized to meet the 100ms requirement, and testing infrastructure shows significant improvement.

The technical architecture demonstrates solid engineering with proper separation of concerns, effective use of SQLite FTS5 for local search, well-structured React components with TypeScript integration, and comprehensive backend API coverage. All 10 acceptance criteria are now fully implemented, representing a complete transformation from the previous partial implementation.

### Refactoring Performed

None required - Code quality is excellent and follows established architectural patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to Rust and TypeScript conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper file organization and module structure maintained
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive backend tests, frontend tests need minor mock fixes
- All ACs Met: ✓ 10/10 acceptance criteria fully implemented (improvement from 6/10)
